aboutme: "My research focuses on exploring and predicting how course characteristics and student behaviors impact student learning in coding biology courses. I am particularly interested in understanding how student motivation and cognition influences their engagement and success in these courses. I am also passionate about using data science and machine learning techniques to analyze large datasets and uncover patterns that can inform instructional design and curriculum development."
